# Spark JIT

This project originally started as an unrealized CTF task. I wanted to write a custom JIT compiler for a simple language. The challenge has since been abandoned (mostly because I started to work on it a day before the CTF ðŸ˜…), but the core of it - the JIT compiler - has been extracted and is now being developed as a standalone project.

The goal of this project is to practice writing some Rust code as well as to study x86-64 instruction encoding.
