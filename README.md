# Spark JIT

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress

This project originally started as an unrealized CTF task. I wanted to write a custom JIT compiler for a simple language. The challenge has since been abandoned (mostly because I started to work on it a day before the CTF ðŸ˜…), but the core of it - the JIT compiler - has been extracted and is now being developed as a standalone project.

The goal of this project is to practice writing some Rust code as well as to study instrution encodings, and of course to reinvent the wheel :)

P.S. This project in no way is intended to be used in production (or anywhere close). If you're looking for something more serious, check some of these projects:
